# Data Storytelling

Numbers have an important story to tell...

This project is part of Data Storytelling course assignment during Data Science Masters Programme at Bologna Business School. To goal of this project is to acquire data from a variety of sources, explore and analyze this data and then to create something visually compelling out of it.

If we cannot communicate the insight of it, why do we have the data in the first place anyway. One of the best practice to communicate the data is via visualizations.

## Data Sourcing

Chosen data is meaningful? Has critical thought been given to the metadata and the credibility of the source? Alternative sources for validation? Any qualitative data to support quantitative findings?

## Data Understanding

Is data functional in addressing the point of the story? Are the findings interesting?

## Data Preparation

How possible gaps handled? Data cleaning strategy? Data transformation strategy if any?

## Data Narrative and Visualization

What's your questions and hypothesis? Choosing an angle? Is narrative powerful? Does it offer a new perspective? Do you unveil something interesting? Relevant for the chosen audience? What does this data storytelling for? Creativity? Are designed visualizations clear? Are visual encodings being used? Annotations and hierarchies? Thoughts on its potential impact? If the headline effectively chosen?
