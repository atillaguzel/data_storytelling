## Introduction: Data Storytelling

Numbers have an important story to tell...

This project is part of Data Storytelling course assignment during Data Science Masters Programme at Bologna Business School. To goal of this project is to acquire data from a variety of sources, explore and analyze this data and then to create something visually compelling out of it.

If we cannot communicate the insight of it, why do we have the data in the first place anyway. One of the best practice to communicate the data is via visualizations.
